# Facebook Clone
## Overview
This project was made by following the tutorial: [](https://youtu.be/B-kxUMHBxNo)

This project uses React library, Material-UI, and Firebase to create a facebook clone with a same look and functionality as the current Facebook.
Specifically, React is used to easily create the different components that make up the landing page of Facebook. By doing so, developers
are able to easily understand how components are laid out within the page. Material-UI is used for all the icons that populate the website. 
Finally, Firebase is selected as our database that is used in the posting functionality. Upon a state change of the current database snapshot, 
the Facebook clone will update the feed. In addition, Firebase is used for user authentication through Google sign in.
